title: Boeing Case Study
description: Ethical analysis of Boeing 
---


#### Overview 
An ethical analysis of Boeing was conducted using facts from the 2018 and 2019 Boeing 737 MAX and about company operations before and after the crashes. To do this, relevant facts of the case were determined, reasonable assumptions were made, and ethical issues were identified. A plan to resolve the issues was proposed in addition to constraints being identified for practicality and to avoid further ethical issues.

#### Stakeholders
To begin, the stakeholders involved in these crashes were identified. Primary stakeholders included the CEO of Boeing, the pilots flying the planes, and the passengers on the planes that crashed. Secondary stakeholders in this scenario include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), other Boeing employees, other Boeing patrons, Boeing shareholders, Boeing engineers, and the families of those in the crashes.

#### Relevant Facts
When doing research on the 737 MAX crash incidents and the inner workings of Boeing, the facts were grouped into three categories: material facts, facts regarding individuals, and facts regarding organizations and the potential stakeholder impacts were noted for each.

### *Material Facts*
1. There was no way for pilots to shut down the flight control computer (FCC) in time to fix things. [7] 
2. The flight display didn’t show AOA disagree messages when the left and right AOAs had different data unless the airline chose the “AOA indicator option.” [7] 
3. When pilots make any electric trim command, MCAS resets and therefore causes the plane to begin nosediving repeatedly when an AOA is faulty. [7]
4. There was a single AOA sensor in communication with MCAS meaning there was no backup system in place to filter faulty data and prevent MCAS from misperforming. [7]
5. MCAS would automatically adjust stabilizers a set amount, regardless of what the current position was, therefore directly leading to a mis-trim situation, which was a system issue that the pilots could not account for. [7]
All of these things happening resulted in the lives of the pilots and passengers being put at risk.

### *Organizational Facts*
1. “Boeing’s leadership was acutely aware that any requirement for significant additional training would increase costs for airlines and potentially drive them to choose Airbus instead.” [1] This shows a culture of trying to limit costs at the expense of safety and keeping pilots up to date with important training.
2. “Boeing CEO and other senior Boeing managers clearly prioritized profits and emphasized cost and scheduling compliance while downplaying safety and quality.” [4] The prioritization of money and sticking to a schedule over quality engineering that started with higher ups in the company set the tone for the company.
3. Culture changed from engineering to business when Harry Stonecipher became president and chief executive officer in 2003. [3] This shows that a culture shift over 20 years ago may have influenced the more recent unethical actions of Boeing. 
4. “In 2001 Condit moved Boeing’s headquarters from its original home in Seattle to Chicago—all to gain $60 million in state and local tax credits over 20 years. With none of its businesses based in Chicago, the move separated Boeing’s corporate executives from its engineering and product decisions and alienated its Seattle-based engineers.” [3]
5. Boeing issued a statement that offered pilots and passengers “our assurance that the 737 MAX is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies.” [3] That assurance came back to haunt Boeing four months later when the second MAX crashed. Boeing lied, or at the very least made unfounded claims, about the safety of their plane. 

### *Individual Facts*
1. The Joint Operations Evaluation Board (JOEB), through evaluations of multiple crews from a globally diverse pilot group, determined that the proposed training by the applicant was acceptable. [7]
2. “The first customer to sign up for delivery of the 737 MAX, Southwest Airlines, contractually required Boeing to reduce the cost of each aircraft by $1 million if the FAA required simulator-based training.” [8] The lack of training for the pilots was a business decision that did not put safety as a top priority.
3. Regarding the AOA sensor on Flight 610 that crashed in Indonesia: “The plane had flown that day and experienced problems with the sensor during flight, but the pilot did not fully report the issue to the ground crew.” [8]
4. The ​​FAA rejected five of the System Safety Assessments submitted by Boeing during the early stages of recertification of the MAX, including two that were “informally rejected” during discussions between the FAA and Boeing engineers. Based on our conversations with the FAA and Boeing, this informal rejection was intended to speed the process up, and provide Boeing with feedback, instead of waiting for lengthy official formal documentation to be exchanged. [2]
5. Boeing made the decision to deemphasize the importance of MCAS and to position the technology as a modification to the speed trim system rather than a new system. [8]

#### Ethical Issues, Constraints, and Ethical Analysis
After doing research on Boeing and the events of the crashes I identified many ethical issues and decided to focus on five main ethical concerns. For each one I used the relevant facts above to make some reasonable assumptions on why the actions occurred and referenced the NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers was used to determine if the issues raised were indeed unethical. 
1. Should the FAA have outsourced Boeing inspectors to Boeing? 
- Reasonable assumptions: there was organizational pressure to stay on a strict timeline and it would have taken more time and money to find someone outside of Boeing to regulate.
- Ethical violation: Part III, Section 5 states that “Engineers shall not be influenced in their professional duties by conflicting interests.” [6] It was unethical for the FAA to have Boeing employees do the inspections for Boeing due to a conflict of interest. 
2. Should Boeing have been able to omit MCAS from the pilot manual?
- Reasonable assumptions: Boeing didn’t want to spend the time and money to train pilots in a new system, other airlines wouldn’t buy planes that were going to require more training, cultural and organizational norms prevented people from speaking up. 
- Ethical violation: Part II, Section 1 states that “Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” [6] Prioritizing money over the competence and safety of the pilots and therefore the safety of the passengers was unethical. 
3. Should the Boeing 737 MAX have been grounded after the first crash?
- Reasonable assumptions: it would have cost Boeing a lot of time and money to ground the plane and do inspections, there were unclear protocols for the aftermath of the crash and a lack of leadership and accountability
- Ethical violation: Part II, Section 3 states that “Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.” [6] It was unethical for Boeing to claim the plane was safe, especially because they didn’t have any way of backing that claim up. 
4. Should Boeing have been able to waive angle of attack (AOA) results?
- Reasonable assumptions: it would have cost Boeing time and money to replace the sensors, there was market pressure and a fear of losing buyers, airlines were expecting the plane on a certain timeline. 
- Ethical violation: Part II, Section 1 states that “Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” [6] It was unethical for Boeing to ignore test results that indicated a faulty sensor. 
5. Should Boeing have ignored pilot’s feedback from testing?
- Reasonable assumptions: it would have delayed the process to do more inspections, pilots may not have felt comfortable speaking up more and stressing the importance of the test results, there may have been no clear role for pilot accountability. 
- Ethical violation: Part II, Section 1 states that “Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” and Part III, Section 1 states that “Engineers shall be guided in all their relations by the highest standards of honesty and integrity.” [6] Neglecting feedback from the pilots was unethical because the public’s safety was put at risk by doing so. 

#### Avoiding Ethical Problems
After evaluating the actions of Boeing, prevention strategies at the individual, organizational, and systemic level were proposed for each of the above ethical issues. 
1. The FAA should not have outsourced Boeing in order to achieve less biased results. 
- Individual: Regulators should be trained on the risk of inspecting their own company’s design and bias that may knowingly or unknowingly occur. 
- Organizational: The FAA should have policies in place to prevent outsourcing. 
- Systemic: Boeing and the FAA should have policies prohibiting overlap. 
2. MCAS should have been included in the training manual. 
- Individual: Ethical and whistleblowing procedures should be made known to Boeing workers, there should be protection in place for whistle blowers. 
- Organizational: The plane design and manual shou;d be third party tested. 
- Systemic: There should be a new manual and training made for any new aircraft design. 
3. The plane should have been grounded after the first crash.
- Individual: Ethical and whistleblowing procedures should be made known to Boeing workers, there should be protection in place for whistle blowers.
- Organizational: There should be a set procedure for the aftermath of a crash. 
- Systemic: The FAA should implement regulation across the entire airline industry for crash response. 
4. Boeing should have replaced the faulty sensors and addressed angle of attack issues. 
- Individual: Ethical and whistleblowing procedures should be made known to Boeing workers, there should be protection in place for whistle blowers.
- Organizational: Differences between actual and expected results when testing should be addressed. 
- Systemic: The FAA should set standards for any parts being used and faulty hardware should be thoroughly tested. 
5. Boeing should not have ignored feedback from pilots. 
- Individual: Ethical and whistleblowing procedures should be made known to Boeing workers, there should be protection in place for whistle blowers.
- Organizational: Feedback should be shared with the entire company to hold everyone accountable. 
- Systemic: Feedback should be encouraged, especially if it is coming from a primary user.
